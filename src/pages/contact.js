          Whether you are a fellow developer looking for some advice, someone
          wanting to discuss working together, or just want to say hey, I love
          hearing from like-minded people and would love it if you got in touch.
        </p>

        <p>The best way to do that is to email me at krogers@hey.com</p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m always looking for interesting projects to work on and challenging
          problems to solve.
