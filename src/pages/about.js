          Iâ€™m an American software developer living and working in Fort Collins,
          CO.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m a generalist that believes in having a broad range of knowledge in
          multiple technologies with the ability to quickly learn and pick up
          new skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love being able to translate my craft into high-quality products
          that have an actual impact on day-to-day lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™ve worked on everything from internal tools for my local government
          to help employees perform their duties more effectively to a
          highly-complex Electron app responsible for formulating chemical
          compositions for a major construction material supplier.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now I am diving headfirst into web3 development to be a part of
          building the next generation of the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I view code as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Ultimately,
          every line of code I write contributes to a larger goal of improving
          some aspect of somebodyâ€™s life. This philosophy is the driving force
          behind my motivation to continue to learn and improve my craft as much
          as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          I currently work as a React developer and always have a side project
          in the works. Right now I am working on my web3 chops, designing and
          building things on the decentralized web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I spend as much time as I can in the mountains
          around my home in Fort Collins, CO, rucking, practicing archery,
          swinging kettlebells around, and reading. I read just about anything
          you can think of, but have been especially interested in theology and
          economics recently.
        </p>

          Right down there ðŸ‘‡ you can sign up to be notified via email whenever
          I write something new.
