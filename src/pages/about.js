        <p>
          Iâ€™m an American software developer living and working in Fort Collins,
          CO.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m a generalist that believes in having a strong grasp of the
          fundamentals and a base technology (JavaScript in my case) while
          having a broad range of knowledge in multiple sub-technologies with
          the ability to quickly learn and pick up new skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m most interested in working in the intersection between design,
          marketing, and development to design, code, and write things that make
          life easier for people.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love being able to translate my craft into high-quality products
          that have an actual impact on day-to-day lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™ve worked on everything from internal tools for my local government
          to help employees perform their duties more effectively to a
          highly-complex Electron app responsible for formulating chemical
          compositions for a major construction material supplier.
        </p>

        <p>
          I view code as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Ultimately,
          every line of code I write contributes to a larger goal of improving
          some aspect of somebodyâ€™s life. This philosophy is the driving force
          behind my motivation to continue to learn and improve my craft as much
          as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          I currently work as a React developer and always have a side project
          in the works. Right now I am working on my design, marketing, and SEO
          chops by writing about the different dev tools I am using and
          learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Specifically, I am diving head first into the world of Web3 and
          learning as much as I can about the rapidly growing ecosystem of DAOs,
          NFTs, cryptocurrency, and all things decentralized.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I spend as much time as I can in the mountains
          around my home in Fort Collins, CO, rucking, practicing archery,
          swinging kettlebells around, and reading. I read just about anything
          you can think of, but have been especially interested in theology and
          economics recently.
        </p>

          Right down there ðŸ‘‡ you can sign up to be notified via email whenever
          I write something new.
