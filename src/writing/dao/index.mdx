How to get involved in a DAO

Onboarding process is all over the map, this is a new space, protocols and processes are being actively developed.

Discord is almost always the best place to start. A lot of DAOs are beginning to implement processes for getting users onboarded and involved via quests.

If in doubt, introduce yourself and talk about how you might like to contribute.

After you introduce yourself, start exploring the server and get a feel for where you might be interested and useful.

Start by lurking and getting a feel for what the different areas are. When you see an opportunity to be useful, take the initiative and reach out to someone.

Index Coop has their onboarding process on point.

This whole process has been a whirlwind and extremely exciting. I am already seeing the possibilities of being able to support myself exclusively through working with various DAOs. The freedom of work this can provide is unprecedented. Work whenever you want, with no attachment, but have a constant stream of opportunities always coming your way.
