I'm diving more and more into web3 development these days, and have been looking into how to use Ethereum Layer 2 solutions to create scalable apps. One of the frontrunners in this space is Polygon.

// Explain briefly what Polygon is and why it's beneficial

My favorite way to learn a new technology is to build something with it. So I followed Nader Dabit's excellent tutorial on building apps with Polygon in order to get introduced to the basics.

If you're not familiar with my general process for learning something new, I'll find a good start-to-finish course or tutorial, follow along with it, building what the instructor is building.

Then, I'll start my own project from scratch using the same tech. Inevitably, there will be new things I'll have to figure out and tackling fresh problems is the best way to learn something new and have that knowledge actually be practical and useful.

## What We're Building

## The Tech Stack

## Setup

The first thing I want to do is get the Next app created with `npx create-next-app wordsmith`
